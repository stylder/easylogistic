                We are looking for a passionate, creative and open-minded professional to join our product marketing team and help grow the YouTrack user base. YouTrack is an issue tracker designed for development teams, just like all our products. YouTrack is a team tool, and differs from our IDEs a lot, which is a challenge. It's the first product offered as SaaS. Our team is progressive, young, flexible and fun to work with. We believe that personality is as important as professional skills.

                <p>The source code is stored in Git repositories, some of which are available on GitHub. Most of the code is written in Java, some in Groovy and Kotlin; low-level libraries use C/C++ (for instance, LLDB integration). The code is covered by automated tests, peer-reviewed and extensively tested by QA. Thanks to this, we keep the quality of the product and avoid regressions.</p>
